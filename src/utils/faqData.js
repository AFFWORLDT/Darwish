    title: "Why is AC Duct cleaning important?",
    content:
      "When dust and debris accumulate in the AC duct, it restricts airflow to and from the components of your AC unit. It also adds these harmful components into the air circulating in your house. AC duct cleaning improves indoor air quality and keeps them free from pollutants and other airborne particles. Most importantly, it improves the efficiency of the AC and reduces energy consumption, thereby lowering your utility bills.",

    title: "How often should I get my air duct cleaned?",
    content:
      "We’d recommend having your AC ducts cleaned at every 6 months. However, homes with pets, children, or those having allergies and other respiratory conditions should consider cleaning more frequently than the recommended average.",

    title: "How can air duct cleaning help save me electricity?",
    content:
      "Dust, dirt, and other debris in your AC duct can form a thick layer of blockage restricting airflow in the unit. This makes the AC consume more energy than it normally would to properly cool down a space. As a result, utility costs for cooling will be much higher. Cleaning your AC ducts can clear this blockage and improve your AC’s efficiency to reach optimal temperature with less energy, thereby helping you save on electricity bills.",
